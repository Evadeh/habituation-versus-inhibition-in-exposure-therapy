"Response ID","Date submitted","Last page","Start language","For a systematic review to compare effectiveness of exposure therapy based on the habituation versus inhibition-learning theories of exposure, we will process published therapy evaluations and code the active ingredients.  	We list the active ingredients in this list, and we have two questions about this list.  	The results of this brief exploration will be shared through the Open Science Framework repository for this project, which is located at https://osf.io/3nze4. The raw datafile from LimeSurvey will be shared. Therefore, please do not list any personal data here, unless you consent to the publication of these personal data.  	If you have any questions, feel free to contact Pepijn van der Hulle at pepijnvanderhulle@gmail.com or Gjalt-Jorn Peters at gjalt-jorn@behaviorchange.eu.","Active ingredient  			 				Definition and coding instruction  		 	  	 		 			 				Fear hierarchy  			 				The exposure trials are rank-ordered in their ability to elicit anxiety.  		 		 			 				Fear monitoring  			 				The fear level of the participant is being monitored throughout the exposure trial.  		 		 			 				Fear level  			 				The end of the exposure trial is determined by fear reduction to a certain level.  		 		 			 				Expectancy statement  			 				Expectancies for aversive events are explicitly stated before the start of the exposure trial.  		 		 			 				Learning consolidation  			 				Following the exposure trial, the learning is consolidated by asking participants to judge what they learned regarding the non-occurrence of the feared event, discrepancies between what was predicted and what occurred.  		 		 			 				Expectancy violation  			 				The end of the exposure trial is determined by expectancy reduction to a certain level.  		 		 			 				Lessen overestimation  			 				Cognitive interventions designed to lessen probability overestimation (e.g., “I am unlikely to be bitten by the dog”) and perceived negative valence (e.g., “It is not so bad to be rejected”) occur.  		 		 			 				Deepened extinction  			 				Combination of multiple cues (internal and/or external) during exposure therapy, after initially conducting some exposure to each cue in isolation.  		 		 			 				Occasional reinforced extinction  			 				Occasional CS-US pairings during extinction training occur.  		 		 			 				Removal of safety signals  			 				The prevention or removal of “safety signals” or “safety behaviors"" during the exposure therapy occurs.  		 		 			 				Variability  			 				Exposure is conducted with varying stimuli, for varying durations, at varying levels of intensity, or items from a fear hierarchy are selected out of order, rather than continuing exposure in one situation until fear declines before moving to the next situation.  		 		 			 				Retrieval cues  			 				Retrieval cues (of the CS-no US association) are included during extinction training to be used in other contexts once extinction is over.  		 		 			 				Multiple contexts  			 				Interoceptive, imaginal, and in vivo exposures are conducted in multiple different contexts, such as when alone, in unfamiliar places, or at varying times of day or varying days of the week.  		 		 			 				Reconsolidation  			 				The phobic stimulus is introduced for a brief period about 30 minutes before repeated trials of exposure.  		 	   	 ","Do you think any of these ingredients and/or their descriptions should be corrected?

En waarschijnlijk ook goed om onderscheid te maken in typen angst: bijvoorbeeld in termen van complexiteit (bijv. spinnenangst vs. sociale angst).","4","","Volgens mij had je 'm al gevonden, maar ik denk dat Craske 2014 een zeer helder artikel is hiervoor. 

Ik ben geen expert op dit gebied, maar ik hoop voor je analyse dat uitkomstmaten te vergelijken zijn voor beide theorieeen. Habituatie is veelal ouder, dus daar worden misschien niet alleen andere proximale maten gebruikt, maar ook bijv. DSM criteria komen uit een eerdere DSM versie dan de meer recente studies over inhibitie. "

It's a little difficult whether the expectancy violation should be 'reduced to a certain level', or whether it is instead a binary thing: you make the explicit and specific prediction and test it in the exposure. Could expectancy statement and expectancy violation even be combined to refer to a 'behavioral test' - as in CBT where the cognitions/expectations are treated as a hypothesis and the exposure functions as a behavioral test of them","It would depend on when this occurs: if exposure therapy works by forcing a prediction error to update beliefs, then some theorists would say that lessening overestimation before exposure would be counterproductive, as it would lessen the contrast between what is expected and what occurs, and reduce inhibitory learning.","Could also have a separate thing for enhancing extinction learning with pharmacological means? The same could go for habituation (a drug taken to reduce arousal during exposure could make habituation more rapid).","","","","","","I would say 'retrieval-extinction' rather than reconsolidation. I the one case, you simply state what is occurring (brief retrieval, then extinction), whereas in the other a specific process is inferred. There is a lot of conflicting evidence about whether retrieval-extinction procedures are really reconsolidation-based.","One of the things I thought of was that sometimes a pharmacological agent is used to enhance inhibitory learning. Perhaps: 'pharmacological enhancement' or something like that.

The reference to reconsolidation is questionable as I noted above, in that we do not know whether reconsolidation is what is occurring. Also though, if a reconsolidation approach is taken and reconsolidation is what is believed to be happening, then it would be neither a habituation nor an inhibitory learning approach. The idea that people focusing on reconsolidation in exposure are pushing is that rather than inhibitory memories being formed, the original memory is directly updated.","8","","Presumably you have already gone through the papers by Michelle Craske on maximising exposure therapy."
